# Real_Time_Big_Data_Streaming_Spark_Kafka

In this project, we process flight data in real-time using Apache Spark and Kafka to perform streaming classification. For that purpose, we have a total of three scripts. A Kafka Producer, a Kafka Consumer, and a Spark Structured Streaming Classification. The flight delays and cancellation data was collected and published by the U.S. Department of Transportationâ€™s (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics. This data records the flights operated by large air carriers and tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights. This data summarises various flight information such as the number of on-time, delayed, cancelled, and diverted flights published in DOT's monthly in 2015.
